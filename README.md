# RewardsAndCategories

Hi so here is the github link for my codebase
https://github.com/aliu730/RewardsAndCategories/tree/main/rewards-categories-redux

Here is the deployed version to view for yourself and try!
https://rewards-and-categories-aliu.herokuapp.com/

I would have submitted the entire project, but the submit link only took in text or something.


SOME NOTES IMPORTANT: 
	The save function uses localstorage so if you are testing it intensely remember to refresh hard clear the cache as well if needed.
